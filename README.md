# Level 1 (MVP):

Load news from API about a pre-set topic (e.g: React)
When this is done and working, create a search bar, and allow the user to search for any topic (search input + “Search” button)

# (bonus) Level 2:

Display a spinner or a loading message when the news are being fetched
Handle the scenario where no news match the user search
Handle potential errors from the API and alert the user
Refresh the data every 5 minutes automatically

# (bonus) Level 3:

Implement pagination
When a user clicks on an article, he should be taken to a new page about that article (with information about author, title, link to the story itself... and comments attached to it)

# (bonus) Level 4:

Use a library of UI components to create your news site (such as React Semantic UI, Material UI, React Bootstrap)
